XZ in Java
==========

Introduction

    This aims to be a complete implementation of XZ data compression
    in pure Java. Single-threaded streamed compression and decompression
    have been fully implemented. Threading and random access reading
    are in the plans but it is unknown when they will be implemented.

    For the latest source code, see the project home page:

        http://tukaani.org/xz/java.html

    The source code is compatible with Java 1.4 and later.

Building

    It is recommended to use Apache Ant. Type "ant" to compile the
    classes and create the .jar files. Type "ant doc" to build the
    javadoc HTML documentation. Note that building the documentation
    will download a small file named "package-list" from Oracle to
    enable linking to the documentation of the standard Java classes.

    If you cannot or don't want to use Ant, just compile all .java
    files under the "src" directory.

Demo programs

    You can test compression with XZEncDemo, which compresses from
    standard input to standard output:

        java -jar build/jar/XZEncDemo.jar < foo.txt > foo.txt.xz

    You can test decompression with XZDecDemo, which decompresses to
    standard output:

        java -jar build/jar/XZDecDemo.jar foo.txt.xz
