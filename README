XZ in Java
==========

Introduction

    In the (very) long term, this aims to be a complete implementation
    of XZ data compression in Java. Currently only streamed decompression
    is supported. For the latest source code, see the project home page:

        http://tukaani.org/xz/java.html

    The source code is currently compatible with Java 1.4.

Building

    The package is easy to build without any makefiles by simply
    passing all the .java files to a Java compiler. For convenience,
    a quick & dirty GNUmakefile is included which builds the .class
    and .jar files and documentation.

    You can test decompression with XZDecDemo, which decompresses to
    standard output:

        java -jar jar/XZDecDemo.jar foo.txt.xz
