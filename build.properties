# sourcever sets --release for javac 9 (or later) or -source and -target for
# older javac versions which don't support --release.
#
# The source code is Java 5 compatible but the oldest -source/-target pair
# (and also --release) that OpenJDK 15 supports is 7 (Java 7).
# If you need to build this on an older JDK:
#   - Set sourcever appropriately (5 or higher)
